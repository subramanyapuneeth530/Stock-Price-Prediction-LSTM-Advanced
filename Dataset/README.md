### ðŸ’» Data Visualization Code: `stock_data_visualizer.py`

This Python script loads the `GoogleStockPrices.csv` dataset, calculates various technical indicators, and generates an interactive multi-panel plot to visualize the stock's performance.

#### **Python Libraries Used:**

* `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
* `matplotlib`: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
* `seaborn`: For enhancing the aesthetics and statistical plots.
* `numpy`: For numerical operations.

#### **Explanation of Each Graph:**

The script generates a multi-panel plot, typically consisting of 2 or 3 subplots depending on the configuration:

1.  **Main Price Plot (Top Panel)**
    * **Content**: This is the primary display for the stock's price movements.
        * **High-Low Range (Gray Shaded Area)**: Represents the daily price range, from the lowest (`Low`) to the highest (`High`) price reached. This visually mimics the "wicks" of candlestick charts, showing the volatility within each day.
        * **Open Price (Orange Dashed Line)**: The price at which the stock started trading on a given day.
        * **Close Price (Blue Solid Line)**: The final price at which the stock traded on a given day. This is often considered the most important price for daily analysis.
        * **Moving Averages (Purple Dashed/Green Dotted Lines)**:
            * **20-Day Moving Average (MA20)**: The average closing price over the past 20 trading days. It provides a short-term trend indication.
            * **50-Day Moving Average (MA50)**: The average closing price over the past 50 trading days. It indicates a medium-term trend.
            * **200-Day Moving Average (MA200)**: (If enabled in `CONFIG`) The average closing price over the past 200 trading days. It represents a significant long-term trend.
            * *Inference*: Moving averages smooth out price fluctuations, making it easier to identify trends. Crossovers between shorter and longer MAs can signal potential trend changes.
        * **Bollinger Bands (Red Dotted Lines & Shaded Area)**: (If enabled in `CONFIG`)
            * Consist of a middle band (typically a 20-day Simple Moving Average), an upper band (2 standard deviations above the middle band), and a lower band (2 standard deviations below).
            * *Inference*: Bollinger Bands measure market volatility. When bands widen, volatility increases; when they narrow, volatility decreases. Prices tend to stay within the bands, and touches/breaks of the bands can signal overbought/oversold conditions or potential reversals.

2.  **Volume Plot (Middle Panel - Optional)**
    * **Content**: A bar chart showing the daily trading `Volume` (number of shares traded).
    * *Inference*: Volume is crucial for confirming price trends. High volume on a price move (up or down) indicates strong conviction behind that move, while low volume might suggest a weak trend.

3.  **RSI Plot (Bottom Panel - Optional)**
    * **Content**: A line plot of the **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**, typically a 14-period momentum oscillator.
    * **Horizontal Lines**: Includes a dashed red line at 70 (indicating **overbought** conditions) and a dashed green line at 30 (indicating **oversold** conditions).
    * *Inference*: RSI measures the speed and change of price movements. It oscillates between 0 and 100. Readings above 70 suggest the asset is overbought (potentially due for a pullback), while readings below 30 suggest it is oversold (potentially due for a rebound).

#### **Configuration Options (`CONFIG` in `stock_data_visualizer.py`):**

The script allows for easy customization through a `CONFIG` dictionary:

* `file_path`: Path to your CSV data.
* `company_name`: Name of the stock (e.g., 'GOOGL') for plot titles.
* `title_font_size`, `label_font_size`, `legend_font_size`, `figure_size`: Control plot aesthetics.
* `ma_windows`: List of moving average periods to calculate and plot (e.g., `[20, 50, 200]`).
* `enable_volume_plot`: `True`/`False` to show/hide the volume subplot.
* `enable_bollinger_bands`: `True`/`False` to show/hide Bollinger Bands.
* `enable_rsi`: `True`/`False` to show/hide the RSI subplot.
* `start_date`, `end_date`: Filter the data to a specific date range for plotting.
